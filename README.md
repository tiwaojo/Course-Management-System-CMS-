# Course-Management-System-CMS-

This group project was designed to test our understanding of Software Architecture Design Processes utilizing the **ADD Process(*Attribute-Driven Design*)**. The system design type was a Greenfield system for a mature domain. This is due to the system having several reference architecutures that can be used to create a traditional application. The ADD process uses an iterative approach at which each iteration is used to choose a part of the system to review and decompose untill all high priority drivers are met. Its inputs are the functional requirements and outputs are responsibilities and interactions the system will be comprised of.

## Part I

Part I generates architectural drivers for the design by reviewing the stakeholders requirements. The drivers generated are: 
- [Use Cases](https://github.com/tiwaojo/Course-Management-System-CMS-/blob/main/Part%20I/Use%20Cases.pdf)
- [Quality Attbutes](https://github.com/tiwaojo/Course-Management-System-CMS-/blob/main/Part%20I/Quality%20Attributes.pdf)
- [Constraints](https://github.com/tiwaojo/Course-Management-System-CMS-/blob/main/Part%20I/Constraints.pdf)
- [Concerns](https://github.com/tiwaojo/Course-Management-System-CMS-/blob/main/Part%20I/Concerns.pdf)

## Part II

Part II consists of the iterations and objectives within the evolving system. Each iteration tackles the reference architectures, deployment patterns, external components and tactics used to meet the drivers. 

[Iteration I](https://github.com/tiwaojo/Course-Management-System-CMS-/blob/main/Part%20II/ADD%20Iteration%20I.pdf) focuses on structuring the system and exploring reference architecures that can be used for the system. In this project we are focusing on the system as a Rich Internet Application.

[Iteration II](https://github.com/tiwaojo/Course-Management-System-CMS-/blob/main/Part%20II/ADD%20Iteration%20II.pdf) focuses on the architectural patterns and components that will support primary functionality for the system.

[Iteration III](https://github.com/tiwaojo/Course-Management-System-CMS-/blob/main/Part%20II/ADD%20Iteration%20III.pdf) and other subsequent iterations focuses on QAs scenarios and concerns. Utilizing some tactics, architectural patterns, and other components will help support the architects design decisions as well as build an application that meets the stakeholders requirements
